# Problem Statement: Smart Crop Technologies

## The Core Problem
Smart Crop Technologies combines AI, IoT, and automation to revolutionize farming with data-driven insights. It focuses on improving productivity, sustainability, and ease of adoption for farmers. The aim is to make precision agriculture accessible and scalable through innovative tech solutions.

## The Challenge Context
Indian farmers face declining yields and rising costs:
- **86% of farmers are small/marginal** (< 2 hectares) with no access to precision tech
- **₹60,000 crore lost annually** to pests, diseases, and poor soil management
- **Guesswork-based farming:** wrong fertilizers, late pest detection, water waste
- **Climate unpredictability** causing 30-40% yield variations year-to-year

## The Specific Challenge
Build a scalable agri-tech venture that leverages **drone-based crop monitoring** and **AI insights** to offer farmers affordable precision agriculture solutions.

## What We Need to Address
1. **Accessibility:** Make precision agriculture tools available to small/marginal farmers
2. **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement drone-based crop monitoring for early detection
3. **AI-Driven Insights:** Provide actionable recommendations based on data analysis
4. **Economic Viability:** Focus on solutions that improve farmer profitability
5. **Scalability:** Ensure the solution can scale across different farm sizes and regions

## Key Stakeholders
- Small and marginal farmers (< 2 hectares)
- Agricultural extension services
- Agri-input companies
- Food processing companies
- Government agriculture departments
